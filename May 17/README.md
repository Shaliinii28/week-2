# AI Travel Planner â€“ Multi-Agent Conversational System

This project is a **multi-agent AI travel planner** that simulates a group conversation between AI agents. Each agent has a unique roleâ€”planning, suggesting local activities, giving language tips, and summarizing the final plan. The conversation is conducted in a **round-robin** fashion until the final travel plan is ready and one agent says **TERMINATE**.
