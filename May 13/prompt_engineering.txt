Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs to guide AI models effectively.  
It focuses on creating clear and specific prompts for accurate outputs.  
Large language models benefit greatly from well-crafted prompts.  
A vague prompt can lead to irrelevant or incorrect responses.  
For example, "Summarize 19th-century history" is better than "Tell me about history."  
Prompt engineering involves iterative testing to refine inputs.  
Techniques include providing examples or breaking tasks into steps.  
It considers the model's training data and potential biases.  
Clear instructions in prompts reduce ambiguity in AI responses.  
Prompt engineering is crucial for applications like chatbots and content creation.  
It requires creativity to align user intent with model behavior.  
Poor prompts can result in biased or unhelpful outputs.  
The process adapts as AI models gain new capabilities.  
Prompt engineering is used in industries like education and healthcare.  
Mastering it involves practice and understanding human-AI interaction.  
It bridges the gap between user needs and machine performance.  
Effective prompt engineering enhances AI accessibility and utility.
