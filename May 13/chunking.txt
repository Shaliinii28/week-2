Chunking groups words or data into meaningful units in NLP.  
It identifies phrases like noun or verb phrases in sentences.  
For example, "the quick brown fox" is a noun phrase chunk.  
Chunking is vital for tasks like text analysis and translation.  
It relies on part-of-speech tagging to assign word roles.  
Chunking simplifies complex sentences for machine processing.  
In cognitive science, chunking aids human memory and comprehension.  
Phone numbers are chunked into segments for easier recall.  
In AI, chunking breaks large texts into manageable parts.  
This helps models process long inputs within token limits.  
Effective chunking preserves context and meaning in texts.  
Poor chunking can cause loss of coherence or misinterpretation.  
Rule-based or machine-learning methods drive chunking processes.  
Chunking is used in chatbots, search engines, and summarization tools.  
It supports scalability in big data analytics.  
Advanced chunking integrates with deep learning for accuracy.  
Chunking bridges raw data and meaningful insights in processing.
