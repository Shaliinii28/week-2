Agentic RAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation with intelligent agents.  
Standard RAG retrieves documents to inform language model responses.  
Agentic RAG uses agents to manage retrieval actively.  
These agents reason and adapt based on query context.  
They can refine searches if initial results are poor.  
Agents may rephrase queries for better outcomes.  
They combine multiple sources for comprehensive answers.  
Agentic RAG suits complex tasks like question answering.  
It is effective in legal research applications.  
Conversational AI benefits from its dynamic retrieval.  
Agents can interact with external tools for data.  
Reinforcement learning optimizes agent decision-making processes.  
User feedback improves Agentic RAG performance over time.  
It handles ambiguous queries through multiple paths.  
Computational demands are higher than standard RAG.  
Agentic RAG is evolving toward greater autonomy.  
It acts as a proactive knowledge navigator.
