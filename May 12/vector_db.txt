A vector database stores high-dimensional vectors called embeddings.  
These embeddings represent data like text, images, or audio numerically.  
Machine learning models generate these vectors for data processing.  
Vector databases are optimized for similarity search operations.  
They use algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor for efficient queries.  
This enables finding data based on vector proximity.  
Traditional databases handle structured data, unlike vector databases.  
Vector databases excel in semantic search applications.  
They power natural language processing tasks effectively.  
Image recognition systems rely on vector databases for similarity.  
Recommendation systems use them to suggest similar items.  
Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, and Chroma.  
They support real-time querying for dynamic applications.  
Unstructured data is easily managed in vector databases.  
Computational resources are needed to generate embeddings.  
Hybrid search combines vector and keyword-based queries.  
Security is crucial as embeddings may retain sensitive data.  
Vector databases are scalable for AI-driven applications.
